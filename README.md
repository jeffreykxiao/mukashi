# Mukashi

Mukashi is an in-progress game designed and drawn by Inkarat Mittongtare (imittongtare). It was originally intended to be developed in Unity, which is better for 2D, but development has moved over to Unreal for a variety of reasons mostly related to convenience, lack of manpower, and lack of time. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

This repo is an Unreal project repo, built from editor, rather than source. This project was created in UE 4.18 and support for any other version is not guaranteed.

The art assets (non UASSET format) are proprietary and hosted elsewhere. 

### Prerequisites

```
Unreal Engine 4 (UE 4.18 recommended)
Visual Studio (2017 recommended)
```

### Installing

Clone the repository's master branch:

```
Click the green "Clone or download" button and use your preferred method
```

Locate the .uproject in the directory of the cloned repository:

```
Example - C:\Git\Mukashi\Mukashi.uproject
```

Open the project:

```
Double-click/Enter the .uproject
You may need to click OK/Yes through some dialogs regarding rebuilding.
```

If the above fails or if you want to edit C++:

```
Right click the .uproject and click "Generate Visual Studio Solution"
```

Build from Visual Studio:

```
Open the newly generated VS .sln file and build from there (Use either Development Editor or Debug Editor modes)
```

## Deployment

We're not even close to live yet. Development "started" on 12/14. Will update this in the future.
